# CUDA_Zero_to_Hero

This document serves as a log of my stumblings through Cuda complexity with knowing C or C++. 
I intend to use LLMs to do the coding work while I learn if I can.
This page document the progress and knowledge I gained while working on CUDA programming and studying the PMPP (Parallel Programming and Optimization) book.
